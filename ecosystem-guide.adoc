== Understanding the AsciiDoc Ecosystem

The AsciiDoc ecosystem consists of several distinct but interconnected components. Understanding these distinctions is crucial.

=== AsciiDoc Language vs. AsciiDoc Processors

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Component
|Description

|*AsciiDoc Language*
|The *specification* — formal syntax, grammar, semantics, and APIs defined by the Eclipse Foundation AsciiDoc Working Group. This is vendor-neutral and implementation-agnostic.

|*AsciiDoc Processors*
|*Implementations* of the AsciiDoc Language Specification. These are tools that parse AsciiDoc source and convert it to output formats (HTML, PDF, DocBook, etc.).
|===

[NOTE]
====
*Key distinction:* The AsciiDoc Language is *one standard*. AsciiDoc Processors are *many implementations* — all conforming to the same specification.

=== Major AsciiDoc Processors

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Processor
|Language
|Description

|*Asciidoctor*
|Ruby
|The reference implementation, developed by Dan Allen, Sarah White, and the Asciidoctor community. Fast, feature-rich, and widely adopted. This is the most mature and complete processor.

|*Asciidoctor.js*
|JavaScript
|JavaScript port of Asciidoctor, runs in browsers and Node.js environments.

|*AsciidoctorJ*
|JVM (Java)
|Java bindings for Asciidoctor, integrates with Maven, Gradle, and Java applications.

|*asciidoc-py*
|Python
|Community-maintained fork of the original AsciiDoc.py by Stuart Rackham (2002).

|*Other implementations*
|Various
|Community members may create new processors (e.g., Go, Rust, C++) as long as they conform to the AsciiDoc Language Specification and pass the Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK).
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Asciidoctor is not AsciiDoc.* Asciidoctor is *an implementation* of the AsciiDoc language. The AsciiDoc language specification is maintained by the Eclipse Foundation Working Group and is implementation-neutral.

== Standardization vs. Implementation: A Critical Distinction

One of the most important concepts in the AsciiDoc ecosystem is the separation between *language standardization* and *processor implementation*.

=== The AsciiDoc Language (Standardization)

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Governed by
|Eclipse Foundation AsciiDoc Working Group

|Defined in
|AsciiDoc Language Specification (GitLab)

|Purpose
|Establish a vendor-neutral, formally specified language that ensures interoperability across processors

|Output
|Syntax specification, ASG, DOM, extension SPI, TCK

|Philosophy
|*One language, many implementations* — avoiding the fragmentation that plagued Markdown
|===

=== AsciiDoc Processors (Implementations)

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Examples
|Asciidoctor (Ruby), Asciidoctor.js (JavaScript), AsciidoctorJ (JVM), asciidoc-py (Python)

|Purpose
|Parse AsciiDoc source and convert to output formats (HTML, PDF, DocBook, EPUB, etc.)

|Requirements
|Must conform to AsciiDoc Language Specification and pass TCK

|Flexibility
|Can add extensions, custom converters, and tooling — but must not break core specification compatibility
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Why this matters:*

* Users can switch between processors without rewriting content
* Organizations can choose processors based on technical needs (language, performance, ecosystem) without being locked in
* Innovation can happen in processors without fragmenting the language
