== AsciiDoc Language (Eclipse Foundation)

These resources pertain to the *standardization and specification* of the AsciiDoc language itself:

https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/asciidoc[*AsciiDoc Top-Level Project*]::
Official Eclipse Foundation project page. Provides governance structure, project scope, and Working Group information.

https://www.eclipse.org/org/working-groups/asciidoc/charter/[*AsciiDoc Working Group Charter*]::
Formal charter defining the mission, scope, and governance of the AsciiDoc Working Group. Essential reading for understanding the official goals of standardization.

https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/asciidoc-lang[*AsciiDoc Language GitLab Group*]::
Parent group hosting all Eclipse Foundation repositories related to AsciiDoc language standardization.

https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/asciidoc-lang/asciidoc-lang[*AsciiDoc Language Specification Repository*]::
Official repository for the AsciiDoc Language Specification, Abstract Semantic Graph (ASG), Document Object Model (DOM), and extension SPI. This is the **source of truth** for what constitutes valid AsciiDoc syntax and semantics.

https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/asciidoc-lang/asciidoc-tck[*AsciiDoc Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK)*]::
Test suite for verifying that AsciiDoc processors conform to the specification. Any processor claiming AsciiDoc compatibility should pass the TCK.

[TIP]
====
If you're implementing a new AsciiDoc processor or contributing to standardization discussions, start with the *Language Specification* and *TCK* repositories.

== Asciidoctor Project (Ruby Implementation)

These resources pertain to *Asciidoctor*, the reference implementation of AsciiDoc written in Ruby:

https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor[*Asciidoctor GitHub Repository*]::
Main repository for the Asciidoctor processor (Ruby). This is where development, issues, and contributions for the Ruby implementation happen.

https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/[*Asciidoctor Documentation*]::
Comprehensive user documentation for writing AsciiDoc documents and using the Asciidoctor toolchain. While it documents the Asciidoctor implementation, most syntax information applies to AsciiDoc in general.

https://asciidoctor.org/news/[*Asciidoctor News (archived)*]::
Historical project announcements and release notes for Asciidoctor. *Note:* This news feed is no longer actively updated. For current updates, follow the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor[GitHub repository] releases or join the Zulip chat.

[NOTE]
====
Asciidoctor documentation often serves as a *de facto reference* for AsciiDoc syntax because it is comprehensive and actively maintained. However, for formal standardization questions, consult the Eclipse Foundation Language Specification.
