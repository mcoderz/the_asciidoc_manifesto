[.lead]
A foundational document defining the philosophy, purpose, and worldview of AsciiDoc as a semantic markup language for technical communication.

---

== Purpose of The AsciiDoc Manifesto

The Manifesto articulates the *core principles*, *values*, and *philosophical stance* that guide the AsciiDoc language and its community. It exists to:

* **Clarify the identity of AsciiDoc** — what it is, why it exists, and what problems it solves
* **Establish philosophical foundations** — why we prioritize structural integrity over visual convenience
* **Guide decision-making** — helping the community and Working Group evaluate proposals and maintain consistency
* **Welcome newcomers** — providing context for those learning AsciiDoc and understanding its worldview (*zeitgeist*)
* **Distinguish principles from implementations** — separating the AsciiDoc *language specification* from specific *processors* like Asciidoctor

[IMPORTANT]
====
The manifesto is a *community document*. It reflects the collective understanding of AsciiDoc's philosophy, informed by discussions in forums, the Working Group charter, and the history of the project. It is not official policy, but rather a synthesis of the community's shared values.

== Understanding the AsciiDoc Ecosystem

The AsciiDoc ecosystem consists of several distinct but interconnected components. Understanding these distinctions is crucial:

=== AsciiDoc Language vs. AsciiDoc Processors

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Component
|Description

|*AsciiDoc Language*
|The *specification* — formal syntax, grammar, semantics, and APIs defined by the Eclipse Foundation AsciiDoc Working Group. This is vendor-neutral and implementation-agnostic.

|*AsciiDoc Processors*
|*Implementations* of the AsciiDoc Language Specification. These are tools that parse AsciiDoc source and convert it to output formats (HTML, PDF, DocBook, etc.).
|===

[NOTE]
====
*Key distinction:* The AsciiDoc Language is **one standard**. AsciiDoc Processors are **many implementations** — all conforming to the same specification.
====

=== Major AsciiDoc Processors

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Processor
|Language
|Description

|*Asciidoctor*
|Ruby
|The reference implementation, developed by Dan Allen, Sarah White, and the Asciidoctor community. Fast, feature-rich, and widely adopted. This is the most mature and complete processor.

|*Asciidoctor.js*
|JavaScript
|JavaScript port of Asciidoctor, runs in browsers and Node.js environments.

|*AsciidoctorJ*
|JVM (Java)
|Java bindings for Asciidoctor, integrates with Maven, Gradle, and Java applications.

|*asciidoc-py*
|Python
|Community-maintained fork of the original AsciiDoc.py by Stuart Rackham (2002).

|*Other implementations*
|Various
|Community members may create new processors (e.g., Go, Rust, C++) as long as they conform to the AsciiDoc Language Specification and pass the Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK).
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Asciidoctor is not AsciiDoc.* Asciidoctor is **an implementation** of the AsciiDoc language. The AsciiDoc language specification is maintained by the Eclipse Foundation Working Group and is implementation-neutral.
====

== The AsciiDoc Ecosystem: Key Resources

=== AsciiDoc Language (Eclipse Foundation)

These resources pertain to the *standardization and specification* of the AsciiDoc language itself:

https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/asciidoc[*AsciiDoc Top-Level Project*]::
Official Eclipse Foundation project page. Provides governance structure, project scope, and Working Group information.

https://www.eclipse.org/org/working-groups/asciidoc/charter/[*AsciiDoc Working Group Charter*]::
Formal charter defining the mission, scope, and governance of the AsciiDoc Working Group. Essential reading for understanding the official goals of standardization.

https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/asciidoc-lang[*AsciiDoc Language GitLab Group*]::
Parent group hosting all Eclipse Foundation repositories related to AsciiDoc language standardization.

https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/asciidoc-lang/asciidoc-lang[*AsciiDoc Language Specification Repository*]::
Official repository for the AsciiDoc Language Specification, Abstract Semantic Graph (ASG), Document Object Model (DOM), and extension SPI. This is the **source of truth** for what constitutes valid AsciiDoc syntax and semantics.

https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/asciidoc-lang/asciidoc-tck[*AsciiDoc Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK)*]::
Test suite for verifying that AsciiDoc processors conform to the specification. Any processor claiming AsciiDoc compatibility should pass the TCK.

[TIP]
====
If you're implementing a new AsciiDoc processor or contributing to standardization discussions, start with the *Language Specification* and *TCK* repositories.
====

---

=== Asciidoctor Project (Ruby Implementation)

These resources pertain to *Asciidoctor*, the reference implementation of AsciiDoc written in Ruby:

https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor[*Asciidoctor GitHub Repository*]::
Main repository for the Asciidoctor processor (Ruby). This is where development, issues, and contributions for the Ruby implementation happen.

https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/[*Asciidoctor Documentation*]::
Comprehensive user documentation for writing AsciiDoc documents and using the Asciidoctor toolchain. While it documents the Asciidoctor implementation, most syntax information applies to AsciiDoc in general.

https://asciidoctor.org/news/[*Asciidoctor News (archived)*]::
Historical project announcements and release notes for Asciidoctor. *Note:* This news feed is no longer actively updated. For current updates, follow the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor[GitHub repository] releases or join the Zulip chat.

[NOTE]
====
Asciidoctor documentation often serves as a *de facto reference* for AsciiDoc syntax because it is comprehensive and actively maintained. However, for formal standardization questions, consult the Eclipse Foundation Language Specification.
====

---

=== Community & Communication

https://asciidoc.zulipchat.com/[*AsciiDoc Language Chat (Zulip)*]::
Primary communication channel for discussions about the *AsciiDoc Language Specification*, standardization efforts, and Eclipse Foundation Working Group activities. Use this for:
+
* Questions about the language specification
* Proposals for language changes or clarifications
* TCK development and conformance testing
* Working Group coordination

https://discuss.asciidoctor.org/[*Asciidoctor Discussion Forum (archived)*]::
Historical discussion forum for the Asciidoctor community. Now archived but remains accessible for reference. Active discussions have moved to Zulip.

[TIP]
====
For real-time help and community engagement, use the **Zulip chat**. For historical context or past discussions, consult the **archived forum**.

== Standardization vs. Implementation: A Critical Distinction

One of the most important concepts in the AsciiDoc ecosystem is the separation between *language standardization* and *processor implementation*.

=== The AsciiDoc Language (Standardization)

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Governed by
|Eclipse Foundation AsciiDoc Working Group

|Defined in
|AsciiDoc Language Specification (GitLab)

|Purpose
|Establish a vendor-neutral, formally specified language that ensures interoperability across processors

|Output
|Syntax specification, ASG, DOM, extension SPI, TCK

|Philosophy
|*One language, many implementations* — avoiding the fragmentation that plagued Markdown
|===

=== AsciiDoc Processors (Implementations)

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Examples
|Asciidoctor (Ruby), Asciidoctor.js (JavaScript), AsciidoctorJ (JVM), asciidoc-py (Python)

|Purpose
|Parse AsciiDoc source and convert to output formats (HTML, PDF, DocBook, EPUB, etc.)

|Requirements
|Must conform to AsciiDoc Language Specification and pass TCK

|Flexibility
|Can add extensions, custom converters, and tooling — but must not break core specification compatibility
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Why this matters:*

* Users can switch between processors without rewriting content
* Organizations can choose processors based on technical needs (language, performance, ecosystem) without being locked in
* Innovation can happen in processors without fragmenting the language
