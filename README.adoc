== About this initiative

This manifesto is a *community initiative* aimed at articulating the philosophical foundations of AsciiDoc. While it reflects extensive research into the AsciiDoc Working Group charter, community discussions, and the project's history, it is not yet an official document.

The goal is to provide a foundation that the AsciiDoc community and Working Group can review, refine, and potentially adopt as a standardized reference for understanding AsciiDoc's principles and identity.

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Want to discuss or contribute to this manifesto?*

The primary channel for AsciiDoc language discussions is the https://asciidoc.zulipchat.com/[AsciiDoc Zulip chat]. This is where the community and Working Group coordinate on standardization efforts, language specification questions, and foundational discussions.

Whether you want to propose changes, ask questions, or discuss the manifesto's ideas, please join the conversation on Zulip. The future of this document depends on community engagement through official channels.
